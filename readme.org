* why snails-roam?

1. [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/snails][Snails]] support multiple backends, so you can search roam notes in multiple backends(i.e. each backend filter notes by some different tags).
2. One file will always only be displayed as one candidate, but you can also search content that defined in the =roam_alias=!
3. you can add comma before string to filter notes by tag

* usage
** 1. write new backend
*** 1.1 write new backend to search all notes

you can use =snails-roam-file-and-tags-query= to create the backend that contains all notes.

#+begin_src elisp
(snails-create-sync-backend
 :name
 "ORG-ROAM-ALL"

 :candidate-filter
 (lambda (input)
   (snails-roam-generate-candidates input snails-roam-file-and-tags-query 3)
   )

 :candidate-do
 (lambda (candidate)
   (find-file candidate)))
#+end_src

=snails-roam-generate-candidates= receives three parameters:
1. the *input* in the snails
   
  - add space to search multiple keywords is also supported

  - all strings after comma will be processed as tags(add space to separate multiple tags)
   
2. the *query* that you want search in the datebase
3. the minimum *length*

   This backend start to search contents only when the input length > the minimum =length=.

*** 1.2 write new backend with custom tags
**** define a query with tags

you can add tags filter based on =snails-roam-file-and-tags-query=

#+begin_src elisp
(defvar org-roam-focusing-query
  (vconcat snails-roam-file-and-tags-query (snails-roam-filter-by-tags '("focusing" "emacs"))))
#+end_src


**** create snails backend
#+begin_src elisp
(snails-create-sync-backend
 :name
 "ORG-ROAM-FOCUSING"

 :candidate-filter
 (lambda (input)
   (snails-roam-generate-candidates input org-roam-focusing-query -1)
   )

 :candidate-do
 (lambda (candidate)
   (find-file candidate)))
#+end_src

*** 1.3 example
#+begin_src elisp
  ;; org-roam
    ;;; Require
  (require 'snails-core)
  (require 'org-roam)
  (require 'snails-roam)

    ;;; Code:
  (defvar org-roam-focusing-query
    (vconcat snails-roam-file-and-tags-query (snails-roam-filter-by-tags '("focusing" "emacs"))))

  (snails-create-sync-backend
   :name
   "ORG-ROAM-FOCUSING"

   :candidate-filter
   (lambda (input)
     (snails-roam-generate-candidates input org-roam-focusing-query -1)
     )

   :candidate-do
   (lambda (candidate)
     (find-file candidate)))

  (snails-create-sync-backend
   :name
   "ORG-ROAM-ALL"

   :candidate-filter
   (lambda (input)
     (snails-roam-generate-candidates input snails-roam-file-and-tags-query 3)
     )

   :candidate-do
   (lambda (candidate)
     (weiss-roam-find-file candidate)))

  (provide 'snails-backend-org-roam)
#+end_src
** 2. create new note

=snails-roam= also provides backend =snails-backend-org-roam-new= so that you can create new note with roam capture templates, you can modify the minimum length by =snails-roam-new-note-length=.
